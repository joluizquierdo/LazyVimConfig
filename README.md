# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

LazyVim is a `Neovim` distribution, which will configure Neovim to run on
steroids ðŸ¦¾. You won't miss any feature from visual studio code, but faster,
fully managed with your keyboard and extremely configurable.

Therefore, In this repository you'll find my personal
starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), customized
a little bit to fit my needs.

What are my needs? Not much really... LazyVim comes pretty well featured out of
the box, I only added some minor changes
and a plugin for AI [Avante.nvim](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim).
My intention is to use LazyVim with the less modifications possible.

Anyway, I fully recommend referring to the official [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation)
to get started and familiar with LazyVim.

If you experiment any errors, I recommend you run the command `checkhealth` and
find for any `ERROR` reported and fix them.

Many dependencies will be missed, and depending on your
operating system, those dependencies will be easier or harder to install or will
have a name or another.

> Bear in mind that LazyVim already contains like 34 plugins installed

> In my case I just want an IDE with all the magic tricks of any modern IDE,
> that I can fully operate with my keyboard, compatible with the majority of
> operating systems, that doesn't require like 4GB RAM or more, with a clunky UI.
> Just something that I can run on a raspberry pi smoothly and that doesn't
> absorb my life to get it running an working in the everyday working.

>
> And finally, I want to make clear that using Neovim even with a distribution
> like LazyVim, will require time and effort from your part: Somethings will
> stop working when updating sometimes, and adding stuff sometimes is harder
> cause that new cool thing that is not already supported and you want, might
> conflict with the LazyVim plugins. That's why my recommendation is to keep
> your LazyVim as simple as possible.

Enjoy!!
